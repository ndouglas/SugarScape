# Roadmap: future campaigns

Ideas beyond the current milestone, roughly in order of how much they add. Each item gets its own brainstorm → spec → plan cycle when picked up.

## Milestone 3: Chapter V — disease (done)

Immune and disease bit strings, immune response and transmission (E), metabolic symptoms,
immune-genome inheritance, disease mutation, outbreaks, Infect/Vaccinate tools, a disease
network overlay and the book's presets (V-1 near-eradication, V-2 endemic, the McNeill
outbreak), plus `vi-1-everything`. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-chapter-v-disease-design.md`.

## Milestone 4: N goods (done)

Goods and pollutants as lists (1–8 and 1–4), n-dimensional welfare, pairwise trade (widest
valuation gap first), per-good credit, per-good maps (two-peak transforms, peaks, flat),
pollution matrices, per-good charts, layers, painting and inspector rows, and the
`n-3-trade`, `n-4-peaks` and `n-2-pollutants` presets. Earlier presets run unchanged except
`vi-1-everything`. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-n-goods-design.md`.

## Milestone 5: Experiments (done)

Parameter sweeps (config values × seeds, each run summarized by one statistic) in the core,
a native `sugarscape` CLI (`presets`, `sweeps`, `run`, `sweep`) and a browser Experiments
view on a Web Worker pool, with measured built-in sweeps for Figures II-5, IV-6 and
IV-10/11 and for carrying capacity vs the number of goods. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-experiments-design.md`.

## Milestone 6: Model extensions (done)

User-defined tag groups with the book's three-tribe scheme (`iii-6-three-tribes`), a pluggable
bargaining rule (geometric mean or a random price in [MRS_A, MRS_B]) with the measured
`bargaining-rules` sweep, seeded fractal-noise maps and image import for landscapes, agent
trails, and a layered credit-hierarchy tab. Earlier presets run unchanged. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-23-model-extensions-design.md`.

## Milestone 7a: Worker simulation (done)

The simulation runs in a Web Worker behind a command/snapshot protocol (with an on-page
fallback), a Max speed runs it flat out, and charts draw downsampled history (LTTB, about
2 000 points per line) while CSV exports keep every tick. Runs are unchanged. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-worker-simulation-design.md`.

## Milestone 7b: Sessions, comparison and recording (done)

A replayable edit log (share links and session files reproduce a whole session exactly, at any
speed), a side-by-side Compare mode (two worlds in lockstep with per-world rules and overlaid
charts), and recording the grid as WebM or GIF. Runs are unchanged. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-24-sessions-compare-recording-design.md`.

## Experiments and science

- **Parameter sweeps / batch runs**: done (Milestone 5).
- **Headless CLI**: done (Milestone 5).
- **Chapter VI "artificial history" presets**: the book's culminating combined rule systems, and its flocking / group-formation asides (Animation VI-8).
- **Credit hierarchy view**: done (Milestone 6).

## Model extensions

- **More than two tribes**: done (Milestone 6).
- **Alternative bargaining rules**: done (Milestone 6).
- **Custom landscape generators**: done (Milestone 6: noise maps and image import).
- **Observational agent trails**: done (Milestone 6).

## Playground and infrastructure

- **Replayable edit log**: done (Milestone 7b).
- **Web Worker simulation**: done (Milestone 7a).
- **Downsampled chart history**: done (Milestone 7a).
- **Side-by-side comparison**: done (Milestone 7b).
- **Recording**: done (Milestone 7b).
